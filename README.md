## Welcome to OPC Foundation Member's GitHub

These respositories contain projects with draft and release candidate material that are available to OPC Foundation Corporate Members only. Anyone who has an e-mail for a current Corporate Member can request access.

### Requesting Access
The GitHub Application can be found [here](https://github.com/apps/opc-corporate-member-verification).

This application must be installed in individual GitHub accounts. It will not work if it is installed on an organization.

When the GitHub App is installed you will be directed to a website that will check the e-mails associated with your GitHub account and confirm that the e-mail domain belongs to an OPC Foundation Corporate member. 

If your e-mail is accepted you will be asked to verify that you have access by clicking on a link sent to you. This link will be sent by mail.admin@opcfoundation.org. Please check junk mail settings if you do not receive the email.

Once your e-mail has been verified the administrator will be notified of your request. When it is approved you will receive an invitation sent by GitHub. *You need to accept this invitation to get access*.

You will periodically (once every 6 months or so) receive an e-mail from the system asking you to verify your e-mail again. If you do not respond in a timely manner your access will be revoked. If you lose access unexpectedly you can uninstall and reinstall the GitHub App and repeat the steps above to restore access.

### Support or Contact

If you have any problems with the application please send an email to github@opcfoundation.org.
