## Welcome to OPC Foundation Member's GitHub

These respositories contain projects with draft and release candidate material that are available to OPC Foundation Members only.

### Requesting Access
Access is managed by the application [here](https://utilities.opcfoundation.org/account).

Anyone who has a email provided by a paying member of the OPC Foundation may request access (Logo Members do not qualify). 

Getting access requires that someone log into their OPC Foundation website account and then login to the GitHub account they want to use. The application allows a GitHub account to be linked to an OPC Foundation website account.

Access must be renewed every 90 days to ensure people still have access (companies can drop their membership or people leave the member company).

Warning emails will be sent out after 80 days of inactivity. If the warning emails are missed or ignored then access can be restored by re-linking a GitGub account.

### Support or Contact

If you have any problems with the application please send an email to github@opcfoundation.org.
